Welcome to PyZora's documentation!
==================================

PyZora is a library meant for use with secrets from The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons/Ages (referred to as the Oracles from now on and throughout the docs for convenience).

It provides easy-to-use classes for each secret type, and allows the user to read and
write any type of secret to a string for use with the games.

OK, but... what's a "secret"?
